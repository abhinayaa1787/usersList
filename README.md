Installed axios using the command 
 ### `npm i axios`
 
 Created a component UsersList to fetch data from the endpoint `http://exercises.getsandbox.com/users`
 
 After setting the state to the component, the ul displays the last names and the first names of the users.

 This component is used in the App.js. The end user who wants to see the list of users will see the following in the react app

    `List of users:
        Smith,Bill
        Johnson,Sally
        Good,John
        Miller,Joe
        Freeman,Jane`
